    Description: 
        - ML.__init__: Initializes the Maximum Likelihood model and prepares a placeholder for storing the computed weights.
        - ML.fit: Fits the Maximum Likelihood model by computing the optimal weights using the closed-form solution for polynomial regression.
        - ML.predict: Predicts target values for input features based on the fitted weights and polynomial degree.
        - MAP.__init__: Initializes the Maximum A Posteriori model with the provided regularization parameters (alpha and beta) and prepares a placeholder for the weights.
        - MAP.fit: Fits the Maximum A Posteriori model by computing the weights using the MAP closed-form solution, including a regularization term to control overfitting.
        - MAP.predict: Predicts target values for input features using the fitted weights and polynomial degree.
